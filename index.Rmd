# Course Introduction {-}

Moodle is the platform where you'll upload and submit homework assignments, as well as access other course-related materials. This `markdown` site serves as a central hub for all course information, including notes, guides, and resources.

## Installing R {-}

To install R, begin by visiting the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) here: https://cran.r-project.org/. Select and download the appropriate R binary package for your operating systemâ€” whether Windows, macOS, or Linux.  For Mac users, ensure you install the correct package binary associated with your processor (e.g., Intel or Apple Silicon). 

## Installing RStudio {-}

RStudio is the most widely used integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. You can download the free version here: https://posit.co/downloads/. Whie you have the option to use alternative IDEs, such as VS Code with the Rtools extention or the base R GUI, it is recommended to use RStudio as the course material will primarily be demonstrated using this IDE. This will ensure you can easily follow along with the course content!
